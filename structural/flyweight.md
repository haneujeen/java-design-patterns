The Flyweight pattern fits more objects into the available amount of RAM by sharing common parts of the 
object's state among multiple objects, instead of keeping all the data in each object. It minimizes memory 
use by sharing as much data as possible with similar objects and can create a large number of similar 
objects efficiently.
