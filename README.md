# java-design-patterns
Basic Java source code examples demonstrating software design patterns. This repository is part of a college coursework and also a personal study record.  
Each module or directory contains its main class for a design pattern. Each main class contains brief summary for the pattern itâ€™s implementing. The patterns not included either are already being widely used so familiar, or better to be picked up from theory.

The patterns used for the example modules: 
1. creational (factory method, prototype)
2. structural (proxy)
3. behavioral (chain of responsibility, command, mediator, memento, template method, observer)

All patterns covered within the course:
1. creational (factory method, builder, prototype, singleton)
2. structural (adapter (or wrapper), composite, decorator, facade, flyweight, proxy)
3. behavioral (iterator, chain of responsibility, command, mediator, memento, state, strategy, template method, observer)
